So I recently hosted a presentation and a workshop on data exploration for a department off-site in Taiwan. The off-site was awesome and I think both the presentation and workshop went rather well, but it can get better!

So what's up with the portable part here? Well, on the list of things I promised to put together after the off-site are:

 - Adding slides online
 - Write a blog post covering what was done during the workshop
 - Make a _portable installation of all the software covered in the workshop_

See that last one, that's what this is.

## What does _portable_ actually mean?

To me portable means that you can use the software without having to explicitly installing it first. There are more definitions as you can see on [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_application), but that's the one I'm going to go with.
